# Statistical Data Analysis on Starbucks Dataset

This project presents a detailed statistical and visual analysis of real-world data from Starbucks beverages. Using Python and several data science libraries, the project explores trends and patterns in the nutritional content of drinks offered by Starbucks. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical interpretation to draw meaningful insights.

## Project Overview

As health awareness among consumers increases, understanding the nutritional composition of commonly consumed products becomes essential. Starbucks, being a globally recognized coffee chain, offers a wide variety of beverages with significantly different calorie, sugar, and caffeine content.

In this project, real-time data is collected, analyzed, and visualized using Python. The goal is to:
- Understand the distribution of key nutrients in Starbucks beverages
- Identify patterns between different nutritional components
- Compare nutritional values across product categories
- Present data using visual tools such as bar graphs, histograms, box plots, and heatmaps

## Objectives

- Import and explore a real-world dataset from Starbucks
- Clean and preprocess the data to handle inconsistencies
- Perform descriptive statistics to summarize the dataset
- Visualize nutritional distributions using charts and graphs
- Identify outliers and correlations using boxplots and heatmaps
- Derive insights that could help consumers make informed choices

## Dataset Information

The dataset (`starbucks.csv`) contains nutritional details of Starbucks beverages. It includes information such as:

- Beverage Category
- Beverage Name
- Serving Size
- Calories
- Total Fat, Saturated Fat
- Cholesterol, Sodium
- Total Carbohydrates, Sugar, Protein
- Caffeine Content
- Vitamins and Minerals (e.g., Calcium, Iron)

Each row in the dataset corresponds to a specific beverage variation (e.g., different sizes or milk types).
